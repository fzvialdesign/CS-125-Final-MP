# CS-125-Final-MP
Java-based android application that connects with a server to explore a database of UIUC CS courses and their information for then-CS 125 at UIUC

This project represents the final assignment for (what used to be called) CS 125 at UIUC. Most of the code was already provided, as this assignment was more focused on playing with existing code to make new code and make test cases.

Disclaimer: The final allowable submission date has long passed, so the ability to use this code to submit the assignment for a grade in the semester of Fall 2020 has similarly passed. I do not condone usage of this project for the purposes of cheating if this exact type of project assignment is to be re-used in future iterations of CS 124 (125) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
